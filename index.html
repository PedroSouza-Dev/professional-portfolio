    <p>Hey there!</p> 
    <p>My name is Pedro, I'm industrial engineer and full skilled in fullstack development, RPA (Robot Process Automation) and game development entusiast using Unity and C#.</p>
    <p>My whole IT history has been started from Data Science improvment for engineering processes. According to the needs of my role, I needed to start develop RPA to automate repetitive works
    to save time, for me and my whole team. From then on, I started to open my mind to other areas of programming and fell in love with web development as well, which, nowadays I work as a 
    Professional Services developer at a Quorum, sited on Washington D.C. and I'm currently developing some games as a side project. My goal here is to show my work and a little about my professional
    and side projects.</p>
